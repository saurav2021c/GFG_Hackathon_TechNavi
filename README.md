## User Interface: The user interface is the component that allows voters to interact with the eVoting system. It should be intuitive, user-friendly, and secure.
## Identity Verification: The identity verification component is responsible for ensuring that only eligible voters are allowed to cast their votes. This may include biometric verification or verification of government-issued ID.
## Smart Contract: The smart contract is the self-executing code that runs on the blockchain and defines the rules of the voting process, such as who can vote, when voting starts and ends, and how votes will be counted.
## Blockchain: The blockchain is the distributed ledger technology that enables the secure and transparent storage of voting data. The blockchain is responsible for ensuring that votes cannot be altered or deleted once they are cast.
## Node: The node is the computer or server that is connected to the blockchain network and runs the smart contract. Nodes are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain network.
## Cryptography: Cryptography is the component that ensures the security and privacy of the eVoting system. It includes the use of public-key encryption, digital signatures, and hash functions to secure the voting process and prevent unauthorized access.
## Results Verification: The results verification component is responsible for verifying the accuracy of the voting results. This may include auditing the blockchain data to ensure that all votes were recorded accurately and that there were no attempts to tamper with the results.
